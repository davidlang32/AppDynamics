Key Improvements Made:
1. Error Handling & Safety

Added set -euo pipefail for strict error handling
Comprehensive error trapping and cleanup
Input validation for required variables
System requirements validation

2. Professional Structure

Clear section organization with headers
Proper function separation and modularity
Comprehensive logging system
Configuration via environment variables

3. Security & Best Practices

Proper file permissions and ownership
Backup creation before modifications
Service verification after installation
Safer sed commands with proper delimiters

4. Robustness

Better package detection logic
Service state checking before operations
Graceful handling of existing installations
Proper cleanup on failures

5. Maintainability

Extensive documentation and comments
Consistent naming conventions
Configurable via environment variables
Detailed logging for troubleshooting

Main Concerns with Original Script:

No error handling - Script would continue even if commands failed
Unsafe variable usage - No validation of required inputs
Poor XML manipulation - Complex sed patterns prone to breaking
No backup strategy - Could lose existing configurations
Limited logging - Hard to troubleshoot issues
Hardcoded values - Not easily configurable for different environments

Usage:
You can now configure the installation using environment variables:
bashexport APPDYNAMICS_CONTROLLER_HOST="your-controller.com"
export APPDYNAMICS_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
export APPDYNAMICS_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-account"
export APPDYNAMICS_APP_NAME="MyApplication"
./install-appdynamics-machine-agent.sh
The improved script is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and professional structure.
